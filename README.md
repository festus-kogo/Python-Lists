WORKING WITH LISTS IN PYTHON

## Review
In this lesson, we learned how to:
- Add elements to a list by index using the `.insert()` method.
- Remove elements from a list by index using the `.pop()` method.
- Generate a list using the `range()` function.
- Get the length of a list using the `len()` function.
- Select portions of a list using slicing syntax.
- Count the number of times that an element appears in a list using the `.count()` method.
- Sort a list of items using either the `.sort()` method or ``sorted()`` function.

As you go through the exercises, feel free to use `print()` to see changes when not explicitly asked to do so.
